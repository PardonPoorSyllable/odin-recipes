        <p>truly a legendary dish… although it wasn't as healthy and balanced when it was the only
            meal consumed <br> throughout the day, it was delicious all the way!</p>
        <p>ingredients could vary, sorts of pasta might differ, but one thing remained always: it. was. very. tasty.</p>
